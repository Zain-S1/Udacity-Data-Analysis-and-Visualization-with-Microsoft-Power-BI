# Seven Sages Brewing Company Power BI Report

This project aimed to address a common challenge faced by many companies: **siloed data hindering comprehensive analysis**. In this project, I built a data model and a Power BI report to centralize data for Seven Sages Brewing Company. This enabled their CFO to gain valuable insights into beer sales and profitability.

This project effectively demonstrated the core data analysis workflow covered throughout the course:
1. Accessing **Data Sources**
2. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) with **Power Query**
3. Create a **Data Model**
4. Generate a **Power BI Report**
